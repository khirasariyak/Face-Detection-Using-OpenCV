# Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV

A small program to detect human faces from <b>webcam</b> stream using <b>OpenCV</b>. It uses pre trained <b>HAAR Cascade classifier</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>OpenCV</b> library.

I also implemented it in that manner so that the rectangle which detects the face, it's color vary into <b>16000000+</b> colors. 

NOTE: Keep the HAAR cascade XML file and the python file in the same directory.
